# Hey there, I'm Elias ðŸ‘‹

**Apprentice developer** building things that matter. Currently deep in the React/Next.js ecosystem while getting my hands dirty with backend tech and databases. I believe in learning by doing â€“ every project teaches me something new.

## Philosophie

*"An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity. A physicist tries to make it simple... if you make something so clusterfucked he can't understand it, he's gonna think you're a god..."*

Simple code wins. Every time.
